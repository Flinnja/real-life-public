## Goal Setting and Tracking
* Goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-constrained.
* HabitBull is a goal and habit-tracking mobile app. It is very customisable. Steps adding a new habit: tap add button, pick a category for the habit, choose how to track the habit (e.g. enter a 'yes' or 'no' each day, or with a number), name the habit, select how often you'll repeat the habit (e.g. daily, weekly).
* Then the app shows a calendar. You can tap a day on the calendar to mark it as successful or unsuccessful for that habit. It gives you ongoing statistics.
